# Data engineering infrastructure to process FSM data

## Overview
This project contains Terraform scripts to provision a data infrastructure on Azure. The scripts are designed to be run locally, using the Azure CLI for authentication.

## Prerequisites
1. [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
2. [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) installed on your local machine.
3. An active Azure subscription.

## Getting Started

### Authenticate with Azure CLI
Before running the Terraform scripts, you need to authenticate with Azure. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
az login
```

Follow the prompts in your browser to complete the authentication process.

### Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Navigate to the directory containing the Terraform scripts:

```bash
cd <directory-name>
```

### Initialize Terraform
Initialize your Terraform workspace, which will download the provider and initialize it with the values provided in the terraform.tfvars file:

```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan the Deployment
Run the following command to create an execution plan and see what Terraform will do:

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Apply the Configuration
Apply the configuration to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan:

```bash
terraform apply
```
Confirm the apply with a yes.

### Acknowledgments
Please replace the terraform.auto.tfvars variables with your id and email and set your Azure subscription in the provider on providers.tf.
